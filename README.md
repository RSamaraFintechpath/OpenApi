__________

* **Motivation:**  
In our work we saw that there is need to add **OpenAPI** specification  
,and saw how much improtance to do this thing in all projects that we want to build.  
and also, Passion to learn everything new in technologies.  

</br>

* **Build Status:**  
Project is completed, Thier is no issues inside it.

</br>

* **Code Style:**  
We use the standard code style created by **SpringToolSuite** Framework, and the name of that style is **Eclipse [built-in]**.  
***"you can see all the styles that you can use it inside the properties of the project as we see in the picture below:"***

* **Technologies used:**

| Technologies      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| SpringToolSuite      | This platform used to build our project in java 8 and it's recomended to make web services because its apply two concepts "inversion of control", "dependency injection".       |
| PostMan   | API tool that we used for integrate our endpoints to test it on postman and see the results after run the program        |  
</br>

* **Features:**  
In our project, when you will see the code you can see and learn one of the best practice work flow to build web service.  
It's simple and readable, you can learn many things in it:  
1. like how to connect with standarad database in sts **"H2 DB"**.
2. Every method inside the code is clear, meaningful and make exactly single operation.
3. We used swagger ui and swagger editor in open api to document our code and make more understandable as you see in the image above.
